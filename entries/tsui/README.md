## What is it?
An editable portfolio editable that allows users to download the created portfolio.
The goal when creating this project was to best fit in the `Gen AI` category.
To do this a single one shot prompt that generates the full website with the zephyr integration was crafted. ( In fact the only real modification needed is the creation of the `public/` folder)
